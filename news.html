		ITP, the pioneering graduate program in New Media at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts is pleased to announce an exciting new venture, its first extension in its more than 30 year history: ITP Shanghai, opening September 2013.

On March 27, 2011, NYU announced an agreement to create a comprehensive research university in China’s financial capital — indeed the first American university with independent legal status approved by the Ministry of Education.  ITP’s Shanghai program will be proud to be one of the inaugural graduate programs at NYU Shanghai when it receives approval.

NYU is unique among the great research universities. With three full degree-granting campuses (in New York City, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai) and eleven study away centers (Accra, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, Prague, Sydney, Tel Aviv, and Washington, DC), NYU is building an integrated global network of scholarship across the globe in which personal contact and collaboration become the norm within and between campuses.

ITP’s Shanghai program opening in September 2012 will offer a unique opportunity for an incoming class of 32 graduate students to explore the imaginative uses of technology in one of the world’s most exciting and quickly changing cities.
