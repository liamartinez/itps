					<div class= "post-text"> 
ITP's program in Shanghai will initially be located on the campus of East China Normal University, one of the country’s premier institutions of higher learning, located to the northwest of the city center. The sprawling, green campus hosts many facilities such as a large library, classroom and administrative buildings.  ITP's facilities will also feature a workshop for physical prototyping: a machine shop, firmware programming stations, electronics prototyping tools, and digital fabrication. An equipment room giving students access to digital photography, video, and audio equipment will also be on site.

NYU's Shanghai main campus is scheduled to open in September 2014 and will be located in downtown Pudong (within the Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone) on Century Boulevard, minutes from two of the tallest buildings in the world and Century Park, the largest park in Shanghai. The campus will include new dormitories, access to complete athletic facilities and a new state-of-the art academic building. Classrooms will allow students in Shanghai to collaborate and communicate with fellow students throughout the Global Network. NYU Shanghai's library will have 30,000 volumes and be part of, and connected to the libraries of NYU NY and NYU Abu Dhabi. The campus will also include performance and cultural spaces, a bookstore, and dining facilities.
